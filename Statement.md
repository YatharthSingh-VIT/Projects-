# Food Menu Management System

## Problem Statement
Managing food menus. Uh, it gets messy, right? Sometimes restaurants and cafes find it really tough to track menu items and customer orders. Stuff goes wrong, people get confused. This project is meant to fix that. We build a simple Python program for handling menus and orders. No big learning curve. It just lets you add food, update prices, take orders, and see everything clearly. No more headaches.

## Scope of the Project
Here’s what the system covers. Users can add, remove, or update menu items. Each with its own price and food category. Place customer orders, select dishes, choose quantities. Check your active orders, bill amount, and clear everything when you want. You can also search by food category. Menu statistics? We got that too. Number of items, total orders, and average order value. But, no payment gateway or delivery feature here. Just for menus and orders. It keeps it simple.

## Target Users
Who’s it for? Basically, small restaurant owners. Food stall operators, cafe managers, you know, anyone who hates tracking orders on paper. It’s also perfect for students who want a real Python practice project. If you hate fancy interfaces and just want quick text menus, you’ll love it. The system is for anyone wanting organized, stress-free food menu management. That’s all.
